# Sandbox
This is the Danecca Arduino sandbox.
As of today it features implementation of :
- Reading a K type thermocouple with a MAX31855 breakout board
- Reading a K type thermocouple with a MAX6675 breakout board
- Logging to an SD card
- Streaming on a Bluetooth serial with HC-06 breakout board
- Combining all of the above to make a tiny Arduino Mega (Freaduino copy) system.
